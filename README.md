Blackjack Game
Create a Blackjack game that enables you to compete against the computer (the dealer). Here are the rules for Blackjack:

The goal of the game is to have a hand that has a value greater than the dealer but not greater than 21.

The number cards have their face values. The Queen, King, Jack have the value 10. Finally, the Ace is worth either 1 or 11 (player's choice).

If a player's cards add up to over 21 then the player loses (busts).

Each round, a player can either hit (take a new card) or stand (not take a card).
